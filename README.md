# How to Train Your Dragon

*How to Train Your Dragon* is one of my favorite movie series. It’s about Hiccup, a Viking who befriends a dragon named Toothless. Together, they show that humans and dragons can live in peace.  

## My Favorite Dragon
- **Nightfury**: Toothless which is the main dragon of the show, he’s a Night Fury, super fast, and has a strong firepower different from other dragons. and I think his design is unique  

## Why and How I Liked It
- I liked this movie because it has such an interesting story and great animations.
- The influence of tha main character made the other people change around him in a good way.
- I enjoyed the story because it’s about accepting to be different and its not always a bad thing to find your own path.
